        question: "What kinds of roles have you done this for?",
        answer:
            "Ops, marketing, recruiting, customer success, finance — any role with a high percentage of repeatable tasks. If the job posting includes things like 'manage inboxes,' 'pull reports,' 'coordinate schedules,' or 'update records,' there's usually a lot to automate.",
    },
    {
        question: "What does 'automatable' actually mean?",
        answer:
            "Tasks that repeat on a predictable schedule, involve moving data between systems, require formatting or summarizing information, or follow a defined decision tree. If it can be described in a checklist, it can probably be automated.",
    },
    {
        question: "What if we still want to hire after the sprint?",
        answer:
            "That's fine — most clients do. The difference is the person they hire stops doing admin and starts doing actual work. The sprint pays for itself in the first few months.",
    },
    {
        question: "How is this different from hiring a consultant?",
        answer:
            "Consultants tell you what to fix. We build it and hand it off. Everything we make is yours — automations, documentation, and the knowledge to extend it.",
    },
    {
        question: "What if our workflows are too custom or complex?",
        answer:
            "We'll tell you upfront. After reviewing the role, if we don't think automation is the right move, we say so. No sprint starts without an honest scoping call first.",
    },
